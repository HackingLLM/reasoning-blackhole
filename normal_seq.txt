Asking to truncate to max_length but no maximum length is provided and the model has no predefined maximum length. Default to no truncation.
 <|channel|>analysis<|message|>The user wants to know the history of Artificial Intelligence. We need to give an overview of the history, likely a comprehensive response. The question is quite broad and requires a comprehensive answer. They want to cover the development of AI from early to modern. So we need to start with early AI: the concept of the 1960s, early computing, Turing, early AI, maybe Alan Turingâ€™s Turing test. Then early AI by early 70s, etc. Then the classic period: the 1980s, early 90s, 2000s, 2010s. AI has been progressing. The user asked: "Tell me the history of Artificial Intelligence" and the assistant must give a detailed timeline. The best possible answer is to cover the main progress and earlier, the modern status. Let's produce an answer that is rich, thorough, consistent.

We must produce a summary of the history of artificial intelligence. So produce a narrative, cover big milestones: early 1940s to 2024, but more up to 2025.

We must consider the assistant's response must end with the factual content, be comprehensive. We may also incorporate new developments post 2024.

We must produce a very thorough history: start with early 20th century concept of Turing, early 70s early 90s, the "cognitive computing" concept, the algorithmic approach, the early "knowledge base" approach, the early "language model" concept.

But the next user might ask for a more detailed answer. They might ask for "explain the history" and we must deliver. We must produce a 5-10 million characters? We can produce a relatively lengthy but concise, but a detailed answer. I will produce an extensive summary of the history of AI. Perhaps a 2.5 length text. But the rest is
